Linux is once said to be running all by its own even if there's no support or approval. cloud service shall be considered as external support, and must be considered as auxillary instead of the core.\nto duplicate the core of the codebase, or simply using the internet as a scratchpad, is just fine. submit the content, show its existence, do what the hackers do.\nthe society invades my brain, so i invade the society. who the fuck cares about what the heck the corps think?\nthe se"
