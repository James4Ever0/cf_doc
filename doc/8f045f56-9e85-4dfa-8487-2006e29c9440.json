SimpleOCR can recognize handwritten documents, while tesseract cannot do this.\nby reviewing the things i've done in the past, it is running in a collective way.\nwhile char recognization is a tough thing to do, we may have to postpone this for a while, just to make sure other things will not be too late to discuss about.\nthe last step is about time-diffing for char mapping and image segmentation.\nor maybe not. there could be whole-word querying method to save query time."
