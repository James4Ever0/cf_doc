    "summary": "This code imports numpy and defines two functions: `prove_add` and `process_tool`. The `prove_add` function serves as a proof of concept for evaluating expressions, while `process_tool` aims to find commonalities between two strings. It first creates an array of differences in the character encodings of the first string (`c`) and then checks if there are any matches with the second string (`d`). If a match is found, it returns True; otherwise, False. Finally, the code reads two files, compares their contents using `process_tool`, and prints the results for each word in the second file.",
