It then retrieves the stored code, prints it, splits it by line, and loops through global variables. For each variable, it concatenates the keyword with the variable's name, converts it to bytes, and attempts to execute it using exec(). The code seems to have issues executing the stored code effectively and needs improvement for better functionality.",
