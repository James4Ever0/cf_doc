    "summary": "This script sets up a virtual display environment for running graphical applications like Gnome Shell or MWM on Linux, using Xvfb. It removes any existing xvfb directory, creates a new one, starts the Xvfb server with specific configuration options and runs an application (MWM in this case) on a virtual display. The script also sleeps for 1 second before starting Gnome Shell or MWM, but it seems commented out. It then ends by leaving the comment section open for further commands execution.",
