The programs list contains the names of the processes that will be controlled. The connectionMade method is called when the connection to the process is made. The write method sends data to the process and logs it. The outReceived and errReceived methods handle output and error messages from the child process, respectively. The code can potentially use multiprocessing support and work with a list of programs.",
