The human component is key, while maintaining the machine part's integrity. The goal is to take control of either the virtual or real computer environment to virtually explore all possibilities. Robotic interaction with the real world requires a jailbreak-like effort.",

However it is important not to destroy the machine part.\nThis structure follows the rule: make both ends come true and then you'll realize the truth.\nEither take full control of the machine or the virtual one. It is not possible to finite all the possibilities unless you virtualize the instance.\n               [Virtual Computer Enviorment]  [Internal Network]\n                           |                     |\n[Real World] - [Real Computer Enviorment] - [Network] - [Virtual Network]\n     |              |                 |        |\n[Virtual World] [Console]           [HID]   [Internet]\n   |        |\n[Sensor] [Interaction]\nRobotic machine can interact with the real world.

So minor fixes is not of our concern."
