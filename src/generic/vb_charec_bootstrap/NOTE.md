The human part is the key structure. However it is important not to destroy the machine part.

This structure follows the rule: make both ends come true and then you'll realize the truth.

Either take full control of the machine or the virtual one. It is not possible to finite all the possibilities unless you virtualize the instance.

[Sensor] [Interaction]

Robotic machine can interact with the real world. However that is a real world elevation, which requires nearly the same computational power as a jailbreak.

Our intention is actually to jailbreak every instance of computer. So minor fixes is not of our concern.

It is about one simple fix in the mind, not in the head. Complex surgeries or patches are just not the thing.
