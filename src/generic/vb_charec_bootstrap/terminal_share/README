it is about live streaming. either do it in python or some conventional shits.

do we need to dump the whole thing out?

better do a ram-server, reporting all absolute location of avaliable ramdisk.

ARCHITECTURE:

	root-ramdisk: location-open, used for symlink to other ramdisks or rolinks to local fs.

there used to be a tool to render screen output to html. in python.

to end:
	Ctrl+D

to detach:
	Ctrl+A D

multiedit will bring chaos here. it cannot be used for global revision.

there's no init command.

direct /dev/null to screen will cause dead lock.
