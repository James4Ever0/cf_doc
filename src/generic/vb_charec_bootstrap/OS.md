we shall never ignore the fact that we are too focused on linux.

linux is just a custom system and nothing else.

it does not provide the thinking strategy along with it. also it does not mean it is the only way to be.

[Custom OS] - [Self-generated Console Input]
            - [Network Auto Routing]
            - [Automatic IPC]
            - [Program Cracking]
            - [Hardware pranking/adapting]

For a processor, what is considered to be running just fine? Why the heck it has to put data to the VGA? what we can do to make things work?
