Make sure every view has been focused.

And by means of focus, the user must interact with the interface. Otherwise the interface is either being taking over or closed.

[Window Manager] - [Focused Window]
               \
[Supervisor] - [Unfocused Window]

For Gnome, it is impossible to simutaneously interact with 2 or more windows at the same time. However, the system can take control of system when idle or just merely read through content but do nothing about it.
