currently, the charec functionality is done, at least to the skeleton level.

however, to find the best implementation for VM interaction, this is not enough, cause shit will know what can be happening on the computer.

it requires attension that by the way we code these things, it works on per-app basis, but not in the general way. for android app we need to type command to find the console buffer size, while DOS has a different approach, which can be done by simply filling the entire screen.

tesseract is a trusted OCR engine. but does it deserves the trust? SimpleOCR can recognize handwritten documents, while tesseract cannot do this.

by reviewing the things i've done in the past, it is running in a collective way.

while char recognization is a tough thing to do, we may have to postpone this for a while, just to make sure other things will not be too late to discuss about.

the last step is about time-diffing for char mapping and image segmentation.

or maybe not. there could be whole-word querying method to save query time.

anyway, the water is so deep that i need to step away from the pool.
