my favourite system will be dos this time, if can be run by qemu.
better store the .iso somewhere in this directory. but it will be changed.
so store a backup instead? ignore the backup file.

[QEMU] - [ISO] 
       - [CPU]
       - [RAM]
       - [MOUSE/KEYBOARD]
       - [NETWORK]
       - [DISK SHARING]
       - [CONSOLE]
