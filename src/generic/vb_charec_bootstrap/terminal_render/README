the qterminal is great. does it work on windows? (maybe not)

windows: either winpty or conpty.

start rendering in electron. node might work but tough.

it seems impossible to change content without rebuilding the whole shit. either host it in server or fucked up.

do it in ramdisk or something. think about it.

consider gnu screen? not on windows. but does it work? serve as a good purpose.
