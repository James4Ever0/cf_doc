to prevent people from fucking with my calculation, it is needed to distribute the source code, the result, or everything that is accountable for storage to put my data onto, giving extra support.

[base/local storage] - [intelligence] - [web storage]

therefore, in the whole scenario there must exist some intelligence which is dynamically evolving and can replicate itself to wherever it wants to be.

such intelligence must be running locally first, with full guidance and all the guts. if not, it would be a tactical error. Linux is once said to be running all by its own even if there's no support or approval. cloud service shall be considered as external support, and must be considered as auxillary instead of the core.

to duplicate the core of the codebase, or simply using the internet as a scratchpad, is just fine. submit the content, show its existence, do what the hackers do.

the society invades my brain, so i invade the society. who the fuck cares about what the heck the corps think?

the self-referencing is bad, and the crucial problem for intelligence developing is not to let suicide happens. a remote storage is prepared andbacked up in schedule, along with the main codebase.

Lazero is running independently, which means it is both OS agnostic and hardware agnostic.
