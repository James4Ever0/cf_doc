the language must be interactive. therefore, it must have response, which can be internal, but eventually must have external feedback.

the language can be harmless when running virtually or symbolically, or running inside a sandbox. natural language can he harmless since it has nothing to do with machine language, and prolog can achieve that too since the only harm it can do is freezing the cpu. (does it?)

just make sure it has proper response and be harmless.
